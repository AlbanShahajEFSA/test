    <h4>Aggregated level data should be specified prior detailing the different cases.</h4>
    <p>It is mandatory to fill in this information prior to be able to use the tool. The information can anyway be further edited and changed.</p>
    
	
	<div id="reportCreate">
		<h2>Creation of a monthly report</h2> 
		<p>
			A new report can be created within the tool by clicking the <b>File > New report</b> button. 
			This will open a new window, which allows selecting the needed report information, that are, the report year and month.
			Note that the report country is automatically filled with the one selected in the tool preferences (see <a href="preferencesHelp.html">TSEs preferences</a> for further details).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Once the report information are filled in, the <b>Create</b> button of the window will be enabled. Press this button to create the new required report into your local machine.
			Note that the tool will now automatically check if the report already exists in DCF, therefore an internet connection is required to perform this step. 
			In case of already existing report, the application will raise a warning, suggesting which actions are needed to solve the encountered issue.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			At the end of this process, the new report is now created and can be opened (see <a href="#reportOpen">Opening a monthly report</a> for further details). In particular,
			a new report is stored in status <b>Draft</b>, meaning that you can edit the report contents.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	
	<div>
		<h2 id="reportOpen">Opening a monthly report</h2>
		<p>
			A report needs to be opened in order to edit or see its contents with the tool. In particular, this can be done by clicking the <b>File > Open report</b> button, which allows
			opening a report by selecting it from the list of all the local reports present in your machine. More precisely, once the desired report is selected, just press the <b>Open</b> button
			placed below the reports list to effectively open the report in the tool. Opening a report will display its aggregated data (if present) into the main table, and it will enable the user interface and its related buttons based on the report status.
		</p>
		<h2 id="reportClose">Closing a monthly report</h2>
		<p>
			An opened report can be closed by clicking the <b>File > Close report</b> button, which is enabled only if a report is currently opened. 
			This action will remove all the report information from the user interface.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	
	<div id="reportImport">
		<h2>Copying aggregated data from a monthly report to another</h2>
		<p>
			
		</p>
	</div>
	
	
	<div id="reportDownload">
		<h2>Downloading a monthly report</h2>
		<p>
			It is possible that the data stored locally on your machine could be lost due to several reasons, such as crashes or hardware issues.
			For this reason, the tool allows downloading the reports you sent to DCF, in order to restore on your machine their last safe version.
		</p>
		<p>
			A report can be downloaded by clicking the <b>File > Download report</b> button. However, note that this button is enabled <b>only if</b> no report is currently opened 
			(see <a href="#reportClose">Closing a monthly report</a> if you need to close the opened report).
			Pressing this button will open a list of all the reports you sent to DCF using the TSE tool, which allows selecting the report you want to download.
			Once the desired report is selected just press the <b>Download</b> button placed below the reports list to indeed start
			the download process. Note that if you already have the selected report in your machine, the tool will ask you a
			confirmation for overwriting it with the downloaded one, since the tool cannot store two different versions of the same report.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the report is successfully downloaded, it can be opened to see and possibly to edit its contents (see <a href="#reportOpen">Opening a monthly report</a>).

		<h2>Sending a monthly report</h2>
		<p>
			A monthly report can be sent to DCF directly from the TSE tool without passing through the DCF website. This makes the send process much easier and, in particular, you can send the report just by pressing
			the contextual send button placed above the aggregated data table inside the Toolbar. You can recognize it by the following image:
